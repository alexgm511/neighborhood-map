# neighborhood-map
Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree 
Neighborhood Map Project using KnockoutJS, Google maps and at least one other API.

Research for the project took me to https://developer.mozilla.org for many different answers including:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events - css: pointer-events
Looking as to how to click on element below another element.

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/marker-remove
Looking for a way to remove markers from the Google map

https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ 
Dealing with error handling on ajax calls

And I spent what seems like days at http://knockoutjs.com/documentation 
    trying to figure out how trigger a function from a ko.observable element
    how to relate the code to the html elements, etc, etc.
